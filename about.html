        <p><b>The Bearded Bassist:</b> Jared Hollingsworth, A.K.A. The Bearded Bassist started playing guitar in the early to mid 1990's.      
    His first love was a Fender Stratocaster that he saved up to buy working at a local fast food restaurant. For the next several years
    he played off and on but it wasn't until about a year ago when he decided to buy a bass too "mess around with" and ended up liking so much
    that it quickly become his main instrument of choice. He now jams regularly and plays with a band at the Valley Music Institute.</p>
