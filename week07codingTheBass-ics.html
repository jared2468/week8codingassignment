    <p><b>Why play the bass?</b> There are several reasons to choose to play the bass. 
        The bass is fun to play, it is a diverse instrument, and the bass in an integral 
        part of the sound a band produces. Most instruments are fun to play but the bass
        has a unique, though sometimes understated, personality. The bass is considered to
        be part of the rhythm section but can play harmonies and sometimes even melody. 
        This instrument is a team player. A good bassist makes the rest of the band sound amazing.<br><br>
